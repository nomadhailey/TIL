#**ASCII CODE**

(**American Standard Code for Information Interchange**)

* Definition : a [character encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_encoding) standard for electronic communication.
* Originally based on the [English alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_alphabet), ASCII encodes 128 specified [characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)) into seven-bit integers (정보 교환용 7비트 부호 체계, 총 128개의 부호 사용)
* Ninety-five of the encoded characters are printable: these include the digits *0* to *9*, lowercase letters *a* to *z*, uppercase letters *A* to *Z*, and [punctuation symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punctuation_symbol).
* The original ASCII specification included 33 non-printing [control codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_code) which originated with [Teletype machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teletype_machine); most of these are now obsolete,[[10\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#cite_note-Maini_2007-10) although a few are still commonly used, such as the [carriage return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carriage_return), [line feed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_feed) and [tab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab_key#Tab_characters) codes.
